## :scroll: Description
A simple puppy adoption app demonstrating simplistic usage of the basic features of constructing a UI with Compose.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
<!--- Optionally point readers to interesting parts of your submission. -->
<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->
Deciding on how to navigate between the list/detail screen was the most difficult for me since I
like the Navigation Components, but see using a Composable for each screen enticing. Time constraints
convinced me to use the Navigation Components approach since I'm already more familiar with that paradigm.
It will be interesting to see what the future of Fragments holds in store with Compose paving a new UX paradigm.
